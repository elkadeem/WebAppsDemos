## SMTP Testing with smtp4dev

To perform SMTP testing, we recommend using smtp4dev, a lightweight SMTP server for development and testing purposes. 

You can find detailed instructions on how to install and run smtp4dev in Docker on the [smtp4dev GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev/wiki/Installation#how-to-run-smtp4dev-in-docker).

By using smtp4dev, you can easily simulate and capture outgoing emails during your testing and development workflows. It provides a convenient way to verify email functionality without sending actual emails to real recipients.

Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the link above to set up smtp4dev and start testing your SMTP functionality. Happy testing!
